## Usage
When you first enter the website, you'll be taken straight to the homepage, containing a brief introductory blurb about me as well as links to my Github, my LinkedIn page and the Github repository specifically for this project. From there you'll be able to navigate to the portfolio and resume pages. The portfolio page contains links to the Github repositories of six projects I made during my time studying coding, accessed by the title of the site. Each project also has an attached image that will take you to either the deployed site for front end projects or a demonstration video for back end projects. The resume page simply contains a list of the coding skills and languages that I learned while studying as well as my education and some of my current/previous employment.
